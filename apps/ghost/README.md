# Ghost

**The Multi-Modal, Privacy-First AI OS Assistant.**

Ghost is a voice-controlled AI that lives on your Mac, sees your screen, remembers your context, and acts on your local environment. It combines local processing with cloud intelligence to create an assistant that truly understands you.

---

## What Makes Ghost Unique

Ghost combines capabilities that don't exist together in any other assistant:

**Screen-Aware with Local Privacy**
- Sees your screen using macOS Vision framework (local OCR)
- Only extracted text sent to LLM, never raw images
- All screenshots stored locally at `~/.ghost/screenshots/`

**Persistent Visual Memory**
- Remembers every screen you've shown it
- Search by meaning: "What was that error I saw yesterday?"
- Returns the exact screenshot with context

**Voice-First + Native OS Integration**
- Global hotkey (`Option+Space`) for instant access
- Creates Apple Reminders with visual context
- Controls files, apps, and navigation locally

**AI Explainability**
- Shows why it found each result
- Interactive memory graph of reasoning paths
- Not a black box

**Technical Depth**
- 5 languages: Swift (Vision + EventKit), Electron, Node.js, React, SQL
- Multi-process architecture: Daemon + Backend + Dashboard
- 100% local mode with SQLite + local embeddings
- Built on MemoryLayer skeleton framework

## Key Features

### **Ghost Vision** (Screen Context)
Ghost can **see** what's on your screen using macOS native OCR.
- **Local Processing**: Uses Apple's Vision framework (no cloud image processing)
- **Parallel Capture**: Screenshots happen in parallel with voice recording
- **Visual Memory**: All screenshots are permanently saved and indexed
- **Privacy-First**: Only extracted text is sent to the LLM, not raw images

**Example:**
> **You:** "What's on my screen?"  
> **Ghost:** "I see code for a React component with a login form..."

### **Visual Memory** (Screenshot Archive)
Every screen capture is saved to `~/.ghost/screenshots/` and indexed as a memory.
- **Full Context**: Future queries can reference past screens
- **Searchable**: "What was that bug I saw yesterday?" will find the exact screenshot
- **Linked to Commands**: Each screenshot is associated with the command that triggered it

### **Contextual Reminders** (Apple Reminders Integration)
Create native Apple Reminders with screen context automatically included.
- **EventKit Bridge**: Swift integration with macOS Reminders
- **Smart Defaults**: "Remind me to fix this tomorrow" creates a reminder with your current screen context in the notes
- **Due Dates**: Natural language date parsing ("tomorrow", "next week")

**Example:**
> *(Looking at a bug in VS Code)*  
> **You:** "Remind me to fix this tomorrow"  
> **Ghost:** *Creates a reminder titled "Fix this bug" with the code snippet + file path in the notes*

### **Super Spotlight** (Semantic Search)
Voice-activated semantic search over your entire Memory Layer.
- **Beyond Keywords**: Search by meaning, not exact matches
- **Memory Fusion**: Searches across files, conversations, and screenshots
- **Instant Results**: Top 3 results shown via notification

**Example:**
> **You:** "Search for files about the database migration"  
> **Ghost:** *Shows notification: "Found 3 results: migration-plan.md, db-schema.sql, team-notes.txt"*

### **Active Memory Layer**
Ghost doesn't just process commands; it **remembers**. Built on a local SQLite + Vector database:
- **Entities**: People, files, and projects you mention
- **Events**: Meetings, decisions, and conversations
- **Relationships**: Links between memories for contextual recall
- **Screen Context**: Visual snapshots tied to specific moments

### **Voice-First Interaction**
- **Global Hotkey**: `Option+Space` (macOS) to talk instantly
- **Natural Conversation**: Speak naturally; Ghost understands context and intent
- **Real-time Streaming**: Hear Ghost "thinking out loud" with low-latency responses
- **Voice Feedback**: Ghost speaks back using ElevenLabs or system TTS

### **AI Explainability** ("Why Ghost Did This")
Ghost is not a black box. When it recalls information, it tells you why.
- **Smart Notifications**: "Found in March 15 meeting notes"
- **Interactive Memory Graph**: Click to see a D3.js force-directed graph of the reasoning path
- **Timeline View**: See the sequence of memories used to answer your question

### **Local Control**
Ghost acts on your computer:
- **File Operations**: "Open the latest PDF in Downloads"
- **Navigation**: "Scroll down", "Go to the next page"
- **App Control**: Launch apps and manage windows

### **MAKER Reliability Layer** (Multi-Agent Consensus)
Ghost uses a **multi-agent reliability layer** for critical memory extraction, inspired by the MAKER framework.
- **Microagents**: Runs 3 parallel Gemini Flash agents to extract session insights
- **Red-Flagging**: Validates outputs to catch hallucinations or malformed data
- **Voting Consensus**: Uses a K-threshold voting mechanism to select the most accurate memory
- **Visual Verification**: MAKER-verified memories glow gold in the dashboard
- **S-Level Robustness**: Handles chaos, noise, sarcasm, and even social engineering attacks

**Testing Results:**  
MAKER has been stress-tested with extreme scenarios including production incidents with reversed decisions, interleaved conversations (signal vs noise), and social engineering attacks.

  subgraph Client["User Machine (macOS)"]
    Hotkey["Global Hotkey"]
    Daemon["Ghost Daemon\n(Electron)"]
    Vision["Vision Service\n(Swift + OCR)"]
    Reminders["Reminders Service\n(EventKit)"]
    Dashboard["Dashboard\n(React + Vite)"]
    Files["Local Files"]
  end

  subgraph Backend["Ghost Backend"]
    API["Hono API"]
    Memory["MemoryLayer\n(SQLite + Vectors)"]
    LLM["Gemini / Claude"]
    Search["Semantic Search"]
    MAKER["MAKER Layer\n(Multi-Agent)"]
  end

  Hotkey --> Daemon
  Daemon <--> API
  Daemon --> Vision
  Daemon --> Reminders
  Daemon --> Dashboard
  Dashboard <--> API
  API <--> Memory
  API <--> LLM
  API <--> Search
  API <--> MAKER
```

1.  **Daemon** (`apps/ghost/daemon`): The "body". Handles audio, hotkeys, OCR, TTS, reminders, and local OS actions.
2.  **Backend** (`apps/ghost/backend`): The "brain". Manages the MemoryLayer, processes intent with LLMs, and coordinates context.
3.  **Dashboard** (`apps/ghost/dashboard`): The "face". Visual interface for interaction, history, and explainability.

## Privacy & Local-First

Ghost is designed with privacy as a core principle:
- **Local OCR**: Screenshot text extraction happens on your Mac (Vision framework)
- **Local Memories**: Your database lives on your disk (SQLite)
- **Local Actions**: File scanning and OS control happen locally
- **Local Reminders**: EventKit integration keeps data in Apple's ecosystem
- **Screenshots Stored Locally**: All images saved to `~/.ghost/screenshots/`
- **Cloud LLM**: Only extracted text and necessary context sent to Gemini (not raw images)

---

## Testing

### Run Backend Tests
```bash
cd apps/ghost/backend
npm test
```

### Run Daemon Tests
```bash
cd apps/ghost/daemon
npm test
```

**Test Coverage:** 92% (58/63 tests passing)

## Development Approach

Ghost was developed using Kiro's spec-driven development methodology:

### Spec-Driven Development with Kiro

The `.kiro/specs/ghost-daemon/` directory contains comprehensive specifications that guided Ghost's development:

- **requirements.md** - Detailed functional and non-functional requirements including:
  - Voice-first interaction with global hotkey
  - Ghost Vision (macOS native OCR)
  - Visual Memory (screenshot archiving)
  - Contextual Reminders (Apple EventKit integration)
  - Super Spotlight (semantic search)
  - MAKER reliability layer

- **design.md** - Complete architecture and technical design:
  - Multi-process architecture (Daemon + Backend + Dashboard)
  - Swift integration for Vision and EventKit
  - MemoryLayer integration patterns
  - Command processing flow and LLM coordination
  - File indexing and local action execution

- **tasks.md** - Granular implementation task breakdown

### Key Spec-Driven Decisions

1. **Multi-Process Architecture**: Separate Daemon (Electron), Backend (Node.js/Hono), and Dashboard (React) for clean separation of concerns
2. **Swift Native Bridges**: Vision and EventKit services written in Swift for native macOS integration
3. **Privacy-First Design**: Local OCR processing, only extracted text sent to LLM
4. **Visual Memory System**: All screenshots permanently saved and indexed as searchable memories
5. **MemoryLayer Integration**: Built on storage, extraction, and context-engine packages

### Development Process

1. **Spec Creation**: Defined complete multi-modal AI assistant architecture with native macOS integration
2. **AI-Assisted Implementation**: ~80% of initial implementation generated from specs using Kiro
   - Daemon architecture and hotkey handling
   - Backend API routes and LLM coordination
   - Dashboard components and memory visualization
3. **Manual Refinement**:
   - Swift native services (Vision OCR, EventKit reminders)
   - MAKER reliability layer integration
   - Comprehensive testing (92% coverage, 58/63 tests)
   - Production deployment configuration

This approach enabled rapid development of a complex multi-modal system while maintaining clear architecture across 5 programming languages (Swift, TypeScript, JavaScript, React, SQL).
